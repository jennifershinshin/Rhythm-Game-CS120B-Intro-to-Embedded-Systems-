This is my final project for my Intro to Embedded Systems class.
I made a rhythm game inspired by the Japanese game, "OSU", where there are lit up targets and the player must click the targets on time
to the beat of the song.
The player gets a point each time they click on the target when it is lit. The score is shown in binary in the 6 LED's. There is a hidden
"power-up" (shown in video), which slows down time when triggered, giving the player more time to get to the targets. However, the
power-up only lasts for a couple seconds. I also implemented a multiplayer system in which a second player can move around a slower moving
2x2 square. The goal of the second player is to make sure the first player does not get the targets. How they achieve this is they can
move their 2x2 square to touch the targets to make them disappear.

What I used:
- ATMEGA1284 Microcontroller
- 8x8 LED matrix
- 2 axis joystick
- Shift Register
- 6 LED's
- 6 buttons

Complexities:
- Multiplayer system
- Power-ups

Here is a Youtube video which demonstrates my project and details on what I used to make it: https://youtu.be/0LZdUrwB_Xg
